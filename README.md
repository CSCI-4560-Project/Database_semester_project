## üîÆ Overview
Our project is meant to replicate a A phyisical Library. This workspace on Github is built using a version controller called Git. This project is meant to facilitate the access of Books in a personal Library that is specific to the readers/users needs. Some People might like to read more of Historical books e.g: The Silk Roads, and others like to read fantasy books e.g: A Game of thrones... 

We can see that by creating a personal library stored on our mySQL server it can keep track of every book the users read.

Our Goal by building this project is to:
-   Data exploration & transformation
-   Full-Stack development 
-   UI design exploration
-   Industry grade Technology Stack
-   Showcase our project 

üöÄ **Requests:** WE are Currently still in Development Phase. Our Goal is to have the project completed and Fully Functional towards the end of the semester,our main communication channel is on Slack.



**How to build:**
-------------------
# Getting Started with Create React App and Fluent UI

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, to see the official front-end code, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
